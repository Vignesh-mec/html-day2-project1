        <li><b>Capturing Pokémon:</b> Trainers start their journey by capturing wild Pokémon using devices called Poké Balls. Pokémon can be found in tall grass, caves, water bodies, and other natural habitats throughout the regions. The art of capturing Pokémon requires skill and sometimes patience, as some Pokémon are harder to catch than others.</li>
        <li><b>Training and Bonding:</b> Once captured, Pokémon are trained by their trainers through battles, experience points (EXP), and sometimes by fulfilling certain conditions like using specific items or evolving through friendship. Trainers often develop strong bonds with their Pokémon, which adds an emotional aspect to their journey.</li>
        <li><b>Battling:</b> Pokémon battles are central to the trainer experience. Trainers can challenge other trainers they meet on their journey, gym leaders in specialized arenas, and even participate in organized tournaments. Battles involve strategic decision-making, where trainers must choose which Pokémon to send out, which moves to use, and when to switch Pokémon based on the opponents' strengths and weaknesses.
        <li><b>Types and Strategy:</b> Understanding Pokémon types and their strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success in battles. Each Pokémon belongs to one or two types (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass), and these types interact in a rock-paper-scissors fashion (e.g., Fire is strong against Grass but weak against Water). Trainers strategize by forming teams that complement each other and cover each other's weaknesses.</li>
        <li><b>Exploration and Discovery:</b> Pokémon trainers explore vast and diverse regions, each with its own unique Pokémon species, landscapes, towns, and challenges. Trainers often encounter puzzles, obstacles, and legendary Pokémon as they explore, adding an element of discovery and adventure to their journey.</li>
